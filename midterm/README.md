# WNM 499: Midterm
## The Problem

You're on your way home from work, and you decide to stop by the grocery store because you remember you're low on milk. But you can't remember what else you need because you didn't make a list that morning. You've considered buying a smart fridge for this very problem, but those cost at least $6,000, and you already have a perfectly working fridge that won't need replacing for the next several years.

## The Solution

A device that can turn any fridge into a smart fridge. It would sit on the counter next to the fridge, and would be equppied with a camera, a small touch screen, and a motion sensor. The touch screen would be the main display and interface. The camera would be used to take pictures of food items. The motion sensor would be used to turn the screen on whenever it senses motion, and turn the screen off when it detects no motion for at least 30 seconds.
